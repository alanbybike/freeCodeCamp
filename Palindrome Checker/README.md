Palindrome Checker first project from freeCodeCamp.org Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

I used claude.ai and wrote some basic instructions. It spat back some code that worked in some ways but did not meet all the requirements as per the instructions. I then modified the code and was able to get it working. The project from start to finish took less than an hour. I only used claude.ai once to get the initial code, the rest tweaked by myself to make sure I met all project parameters.
